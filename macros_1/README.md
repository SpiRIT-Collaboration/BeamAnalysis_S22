# macros_1 #
First step of the analysis.

To run macros in this directory, at first you have to `make`, and execute `run.sh` which runs *RIDFtoPLARAW* and *RIDFtoPPACRAW* to make root file of S22 experiment.
```bash
$ make
$ source ./run.sh
```

`RIDFtoPLARAW.cc` : Generate root file containing TTree with raw MHTDC data of Plastic.

`RIDFtoPPACRAW.cc` : Generate root file containing TTree with raw MHTDC data of PPAC.

`anaPlasticTMean.C` : Analyze root file generated by `RIDFtoPLARAW.cc` to obtain parameter of proper beam timing.

`anaPPACTMean.C` : Analyze root file generated by `RIDFtoPPACRAW.cc` to obtain parameter of proper beam timing.
